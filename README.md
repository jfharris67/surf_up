## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii, in the months of June and December in order to evaluate the sustainability of a surf and ice cream shop business throughout the year. The analysis is based on temperature data collected for the two months and focuses on finding the summary statistics and identifying key differences between the two.

## Results

### June Temps
- The average temperature in June is 74.9°F, with a standard deviation of 3.25°F.
- The minimum temperature recorded was 64°F and the maximum was 85°F.
- The median temperature is 75°F, with 25% of the days being cooler than 73°F and 75% being warmer than 77°F.

## Summary

The results show the business could be more sustainable in June than December. Performing an anaysis for other months would be a good idea to evaluate year round temperature impacts.

### Further Analysis

I thought I would look into preceiptation levels to see if there could be an impact.  I created two more queries analysing precipitation levels for June and December.

### June Precipitation

- The average precipitation in June is 0.14 inches, with a standard deviation of 0.34 inches.
- The minimum precipitation recorded was 0.0 inches and the maximum was 4.43 inches.
- The median precipitation is 0.02 inches, with 25% of the days having less than 0.0 inches and 75% having less than 0.12 inches of precipitation.

### Overall Summary

The analysis of the June and December overall weather data indicates that June is warmer with lower standard deviations for both temperature and rain compared to December. As mentioned above, June looks more sustainable even with both metrics taken into account. It is important to note that December has a slightly higher average precipitation than June, which could impact the surfing conditions.
